    <description><![CDATA[At first glance Arlington seems to be one more pleasant suburb of Boston—a good place to live without much for visitors to see.  Not so.  The town paid a pivotal role in the American Revolution, as this stroll down the popular new Minuteman Rail Trail and through the heart of town will reveal to you.  Along the way you’ll also discover its appealing restaurants, retail shops, and pond-studded green space.<br><br>Arlington, once known as Menotomy (its Native American name), stepped into American history on April 19, 1775.  On that date the townsfolk watched the main British force pass on their route to Concord.  When lightly protected supply trains followed, Arlingtonians attacked.  Their rewards were the first British prisoners and stores captured in the Revolution.  More than half of the casualties that day took place on this portion of the historic battle road.<br><br>Several buildings dating from the Revolutionary War period remain—surrounded now by an active, lively urban community.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[A 15-minute walk from Alewife Station, this pond was left by a glacier long ago.  The Reverend Cotton Mather once came here to fish and, like many other amateur fishermen, fell into the pond--"the boat being tickelish."  Frightened British soldiers, pursued by Minutemen on April 19, 1775, jumped from supply train wagons and ran to the pond, where they threw their guns into the water, trying to keep the weapons from falling into the hands of the rebellious Minutemen.  In the nineteenth century the pond became known for its rice, each winter some 250 men harvested up to 60,000 tons for shipment all over the world.  The industry continued until 1930.]]></description>
